This repository contains the KSchool Data Science Master Project.

The project focuses on a common problem of many parents of the Community of Madrid when enrolling their children in public schools: the lack of places.

The purpose of the project is twofold:

- Analyze the relationship between supply and demand of places in public schools, and determine if there is any kind of dislocation.

- Try to predict the probability of not getting a place in a school.

You can find a early approach of the project [here][http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/giltrapo/SchoolaRize/blob/master/TFM_first_approach/TFM_first_approach.html#/].

The project is under development, so objectives of the project could change.
